# Code for "Evaluating the potential benefits and pitfalls of combining protein and expression quantitative trait loci in evidencing drug targets"

This repository contains the code used to generate results presented in our paper, "Evaluating the potential benefits and pitfalls of combining protein and expression quantitative trait loci in evidencing drug targets". We provide the code as-is, for the purposes of open science and reproducibility, with no expectation of maintenance or support.
